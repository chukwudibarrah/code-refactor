# Code-Refactor Challenge Project

## Description
The aim of the code-refactor challenge is to check the student's practical understanding of semantic HTML in the development of accessible websites. The challenge presents an existing website that will need to be "refactored"; checking for generic HTML tags and introducing assessibility tools-friendly semantic HTML tags and elements into the development.

## End Goal

- Improve the code with semantic HTML to optimise it for accessibility and search engines
- Ensure the code (HTML and CSS) follows a logical structure from the top to the bottom of the webpage, with heading attributes in sequencial order
- Include alt text in all images on the webpage for accessibility and search engines, and ensure that the webpage contains a descriptive title
- Ensure that all links in the webpage are functional
- On satisfactory conclusion, deploy page on GitHub Pages
